This Project is for creating a AC and DC Potentiostat using the Rodeostat and Red Pitaya Devices,
It has three things for Python 3.8 using Pycharm, 

1) A program to do Cyclic Voltammetry on A Rodeostat and A program for manual control of the Rodeostat
2) A program to control a Red Pitaya to output a Ac Wave and Measure the Input and Output through basic Oscope readings as well as a Lock On Amplifier 
3) A program to control both the Red Pitaya and Rodeostat to do an AC with DC Biased Experiment simultaneously AC Cylic Voltametry

These programs use CSV files to save their Data and plot it in matlib plot as well as a custom PyRPL controller with its own built in scope.yaml file.

I HIGHLY Recommend if you are going to use this you dowload the full zipped file I have provided and Use Python 3.8 and download the dependencies needed. You may notice that the venv. file you need to run this code is custom modified so you will need to download the virtual enviorment from here or fix it yourself.

Have a great day :)
