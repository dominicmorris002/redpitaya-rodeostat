This Project has three things for Python 3.8 using Pycharm, 
1) A program to do Cyclic Voltammetry on A Rodeostat
2) A program to control a Red Pitaya to output a Ac Wave and Measure the Input and Output
3)  A program to control both the Red Pitaya and Rodeostat to do both simultaneously 

Have a great day :)
