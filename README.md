This Project has three things for Python 3.8, 
1) A program to control the Red Pitaya to output a Ac Wave and Use A lockin Amplifier
2) A program to do Cyclic Voltammetry on A Rodeostat
3) A Program That Uses The Red Pitaya and The Rodeostat to conduct a Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) Experiment

Have a great day :)
